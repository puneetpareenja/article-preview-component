# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

![Design preview for the Article preview component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my submission for Frontend Mentor's Article Preview Challenge. I have used CSS Grid, Jquery and SASS in this solution.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

The project is hoste on [Vercel](https://article-preview-component-plum-pi.vercel.app/)

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript you'll need for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
